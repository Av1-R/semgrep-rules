          Detected use of the 'none' algorithm in a JWT token. The 'none' algorithm assumes the  
          integrity of the token has already been verified. This would allow a malicious actor to
          forge a JWT token that will automatically be verified. Do not explicitly use the 'none'
          algorithm. Instead, use an algorithm such as 'HS256'.

          A hard-coded credential was detected. It is not recommended to store credentials in source-
          code, as this risks secrets being leaked and used by either an internal or external        
          malicious adversary. It is recommended to use environment variables to securely provide    
          credentials or retrieve credentials from a secure vault or HSM (Hardware Security Module).
